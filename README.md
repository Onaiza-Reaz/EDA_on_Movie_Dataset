## Movie Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for my project to analyze a dataset of movie information. The dataset includes title, director, genre, release year, rating, and revenue. I used Python and various data science libraries to explore the data and answer some interesting questions.

**Key findings:**

* The highest rated movies are typically directed by well-known and respected directors.
* The most popular movie titles are usually big-budget blockbusters.
* There is a positive correlation between rating and revenue, but it is not perfect.
* Action movies are the most popular genre, followed by comedy and drama.

**To run the code:**

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the code.
